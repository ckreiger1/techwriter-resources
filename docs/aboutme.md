# About me

![Image of Chad Kreiger](ckreiger_pic300.jpg)

My name is Chad Kreiger and I'm a technical writer based in Portland, Oregon. I'm experienced in healthcare analytics, science education, and mortgage banking documentation. With more than a decade of MadCap Flare experience, I've also taught graduate-level topic-based authoring with MadCap Flare course at Portland State University.  

I've presented at the MadWorld Technical Communication conference (2023, 2022, and 2018) and via webinar for MadCap Software regarding Flare implementation and content migration. I presented "Reduce, Re-Use, Repurpose: Topic-Based Technical Communication with MadCap Flare" at SIGDOC 2019. I'm also the founder and organizer of the Portland Flare User Group.  

My professional interests include technical writing, Flare project setup and maintenance, topic-based writing training and instructing, software documentation, deployment strategy, data analytics, git workflows, and scrum/agile methodologies.  

Giving back to my community is also important to me. I'm an active volunteer with the Oregon Food Bank and Store to Door, and I also volunteer with local schools and various community organizations.  

If you are ever in Portland, let's meet up for :beers:
