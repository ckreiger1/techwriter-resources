A style guide in technical writing is a set of standardized guidelines that ensure consistency and clarity across all technical documents. It helps writers adhere to a uniform tone, structure, and formatting, making the document easier to understand and more professional. The style guide may cover everything from grammar and punctuation to document organization and visual elements.
