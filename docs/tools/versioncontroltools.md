# Version control tools

Version control helps technical writers track, manage, and collaborate on document revisions over time. It helps you maintain a history of changes made to documentation, enabling you to revert to previous versions, collaborate with team members without conflict, and ensures consistency and accuracy throughout the writing process. Using version control helps technical writers efficiently manage updates, handle multiple document versions, and streamlines the process of reviewing and publishing content. This is particularly useful when working on large, collaborative projects and can help you manage numerous revisions and changes.

Some common version control tools for technical writers include

* Git
* Team Foundation Server (TFS)
* Perforce

And many more!
