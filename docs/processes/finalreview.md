# Final Review

Final reviews are an important one of the most important parts of the documentation lifecycle. Self-reviews and peer reviews help ensure your documentation provides all critical information and conforms to decided upon styles and standards. Subject area reviews are also critical to the process and these help ensure the accuracy and further drive home your credibility as a writer. It is important to set boundaries with SME reviewers to ensure they focus the majority of their time reading for accuracy, and not so much grammar and punctuation. Targeted SME reviews also help expedite the process. Try to only provide only the specific topics for review where critical updates have been made. This helps limit the review scope, which not only provides a courtesy to the reviewer, but helps with their turn times too.
