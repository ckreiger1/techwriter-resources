# Publishing

With your documentation all ready to go, be sure you allow yourself sufficient time for final publishing protocols. Whether this is as simple as sharing a document on a Sharepoint site, or involves a complicated deployment pipeline, your document planning should have the details needed for document delivery expectations. Some workflows, such as docs-as-code or other such technical processes, often require collaboration with dev ops engineers and having your files at the right place at just the right time is critical for a smooth release. Once your documentation is published, it is always a good idea to check them over once more in their live environment. Then, give yourself a moment to breathe a sigh of relief. If this was a one-time release, you may be on to your next assignment. In a continuous release software cycle, you might already be on to your next sprint work. Either way, always remember to celebrate each published set of files, and reflect on what you have accomplished   :smile:
