# Start writing

After you complete your document planning and you are ready to begin your writing phase of the documentation process, there are several key steps to gather accurate and relevant information. This includes attending meetings and demos, gathering information from subject matter experts, and testing the software yourself. The goal is to understand the product thoroughly in order to create clear, user-friendly documentation.

The typical process begins with a broad overview statement that provides context for the user role, detailing who the audience is, what task is being performed, when it should be done, and why it is necessary. After this context, the "how-to" instructions follow, providing step-by-step guidance for users to complete the task efficiently.

This approach ensures that the technical documentation is both accurate and useful to the target audience.

During your document planning, you should have also decided on the method for documentation delivery and should choose your writing tools and resoures accordingly.
