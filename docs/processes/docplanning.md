# Document planning

A technical writing document plan is a blueprint or outline that details the structure, content, and process for creating a technical document. It serves as a guide to make sure that the document is well-organized, clear, and meets the needs of its intended audience. The plan helps to streamline the writing process and provides a framework for managing the various aspects of technical writing. 

When starting a new technical writing project, it's helpful to gather information about your audience, knowledge channels and subject area experts, and overall expectations for content delivery and timelines. 

* **Product/Domain Background**: Gain as much background knowledge in the domain as you can. If it's a product you are writing about, learn about it's industry, how it's used, what problem it solves, and its user base. 
* **Reason for Updates or Change**: For example, is this a new product launch or is an existing product undergoing maintenance-based updates?
* **Existing Documentation (if any)**: It's helpful to read the resources already available to understand the scope for writing about changes.
* **Target Audience(s)**: These could include users, admin, internal admin, etc.
* **User Needs Assessment**: Learn about the personas, their painpoints, expertise, and overall needs so that your documentation best serves your audience. 
* **Subject Area Experts/Key stakeholders**: Who can answer questions as they arise or can offer insightful product use cases and tips.
* **Knowledge Resources and Channels**: Where can you learn more? What meetings should you attend? 
* **Test Environments (if applicable)**: Are their environments available for you to test processes or try out new features?
* **Reviewer/Approver**: Who are trusted reviewers and who needs to approve documentation before the documentation is published. 
* **Content Delivery**: What format will documentation be delivered in and what does the deployment pipeline look like?
* **Deadline or Release Cycle timelines**: When does content need to be live? What other document milestones need to happen along the way?
